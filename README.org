* A Quick Org Export to Reveal.js Demo

The contents of the reveal.js directory in this repository were cloned from =git@github.com:hakimel/reveal.js.git= and then built using nodejs. The .git directory was removed so it could be added without sub{module,tree} hackery.

A script has been added to impress.org to set random values for the positions and rotations of the slides. Setting these by hand in the HTML is not so much fun.
